nodes = n
edges = (n-1) * d
n-1 because we exclude sink node
FF is O(mC) where m is the number of edges (n -1) * d and C is the capacity of the total network flow
we know that capacity of each edge is 1, so we have a total capacity of the total number of edges in the graph - m

Therefore, our running time is O(m * m) or O( ((n-1) * d) * ((n-1)*d) )
