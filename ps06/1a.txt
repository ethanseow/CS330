We will do a proof by induction

For A to terminate, any function call to A must reach A(0)

Base Case:
A(0) is A(0), therefore this function must terminate

Inductive Hypothesis:
Assume A(n) and all numbers before n reach A(0)

Inductive Step:
We will now prove that A(n+1) will also reach A(0)

Case 1: n+1 is odd
if n+1 is odd, then A(n+1) -> A(2n) because of the conditional "return A(2(n-1)) + 1"
A(2n) -> A(n) by the condition of "if n is even return A(n/2)"
Thus A(2n) -> A(n) which reachs A(0)

Case 2:n+1 is even
if n+1 is even then, A(n+1) -> A((n+1)/2).
We said that A(n) and all numbers before n reach A(0).
(n+1)/2 is a number before n.
Thus A((n+1)/2) reaches A(0)
